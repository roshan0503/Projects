Hand and Face Detection with Voice Command
This project utilizes computer vision techniques for hand and face detection in real-time video streams. It incorporates the MediaPipe library for hand detection and Haar cascade classifiers for face detection. Additionally, it employs OpenCV for image processing and manipulation.

Features
Real-time detection of hand gestures.
Face detection using MediaPipe and Haar cascade classifiers.
Voice command alerts for raised hands and group discussions.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
MediaPipe (pip install mediapipe)
Pyttsx3 (pip install pyttsx3)

Customization
Add student images to the student_images folder for personalized face recognition.
Modify the default_name variable to change the default name for unrecognized faces.
Adjust detection thresholds and parameters in the code as needed.
